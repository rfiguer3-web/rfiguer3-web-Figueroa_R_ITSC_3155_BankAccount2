# ITSC3155 BankAccount Part 2
## Inheritance and Modularization

This assignment extends a previous assignment (BankAccount part 1) and intends to do the following:
- Add two subclasses (use inheritance):
  - Savings account with interest 
  - Checking account with transfer limitation
- Create protected and private members
  - Account number
  - Routing number
- Put each class in a separate module
  - Create a main file to run your program
  - Import saving and checking class into main file.
  - Create a scenario (i.e a user opens a checking account and withdraws $x) and call proper methods to illustrate the scenario.
  - Create at least two different instances from each to make sure it works.
